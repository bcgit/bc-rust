# 0.1.3 Features / Changelog

## Major features

## Minor features / bug fixes

* bug fixes to the way SHA3/SHAKE handled absorbing and squeezing a partial final byte.
* Design discussions about whether core::traits::XOF (in the abstract) should allow interleaving absorb -> squeeze ->
  absorb (ie "absorb-after-squeeze). Outcome: absorb-after-squeeze forbidden. Could be changed in the future.

SHA-2 (PR #88):

* `Hash::do_final_partial_bits()` / `do_final_partial_bits_out()` are now implemented for SHA-224/256/384/512
  (FIPS 180-4 s. 5.1), bringing SHA-2 to parity with SHA-3 for messages whose length is not a multiple of 8 bits.
  Previously these methods hit `unimplemented!()` -- a panic behind a `Result`-returning API. `num_partial_bits` may be
  0..=7 (0 behaves exactly as `do_final_out()`); larger values return `HashError::InvalidLength`. The trailing bits are
  taken from the least significant bits of `partial_byte`, the same convention as SHA-3 (see the `Hash` trait docs).
* Initial hash values are now compile-time constants (`const H0` on the params traits), removing a runtime
  match-on-`OUTPUT_LEN` and its `panic!` arm. `HashAlgParams` for the public types is forwarded from the `*Params`
  structs, so `OUTPUT_LEN` / `BLOCK_LEN` are defined once.
* Crate docs: fixed SHA-3/SHAKE copy-paste text, added a partial-bits usage example, "Memory Usage" and
  "Security Considerations" sections, and documented the `*_NAME` constants. The 2^64-byte message-length limit is
  now stated.

Testing:

* SHA-2 now runs the NIST CAVP SHAVS vector sets from bc-test-data (`crypto/sha2`: ShortMsg, LongMsg and Monte Carlo;
  bit- and byte-oriented, ~12k cases of which ~5.4k are bit-length messages) using the same `../bc-test-data` lookup
  convention as the mldsa/mlkem crates; the tests skip with a warning if the repo is not checked out. The SHAVS files
  pack trailing message bits MSB-first, so the harness shifts them into the LSB convention used by the API. Note that
  `cargo mutants` runs in a copied tree where `../bc-test-data` does not resolve, so these tests do not contribute to
  mutation coverage.

Bit-oriented messages:

* `Hash::do_final_partial_bits()` / `do_final_partial_bits_out()` accept `num_partial_bits` in 0..=7 (0 meaning the
  message ends on a byte boundary); larger values return `HashError::InvalidLength` instead of panicking. The convention
  is the same for every hash family: the trailing bits are in the least significant bits of `partial_byte` (FIPS 202
  Appendix B.1) -- see the `Hash` trait docs, including the note on the MSB-first packing used by the NIST CAVP SHA-2
  vector files.

SHA-3 / SHAKE (PR #87):

* Fixed `XOF::squeeze_partial_byte_final()`: when it was the first squeeze it bypassed the SHAKE `1111` domain suffix
  and returned raw Keccak output, and it returned the *high* rather than the low `num_bits` bits of the output byte.
  The existing test used `0xFF`, which masked the second error.
* Fixed `XOF::absorb_last_partial_byte()` for `num_partial_bits == 4`: the 4 message bits plus the `1111` suffix
  exactly filled a byte and the sponge did not switch to squeezing, so the first squeeze appended the suffix a second
  time. Every SHAKE message with a bit length of 4 mod 8 was affected. Found by the new CAVP harness.
* `absorb_last_partial_byte()` and `do_final_partial_bits*()` now validate `num_partial_bits` before use; previously
  SHA-3 accepted 8..15 and absorbed garbage, panicked for >= 16, and SHAKE rejected 0 with an error message claiming
  `[0,7]`.
* Interleaving absorb -> squeeze -> absorb remains rejected with `HashError::InvalidState`; the `XOF` trait docs now
  explain why (it is the duplex construction, not SHAKE).
* `HashAlgParams` for the SHA-3 types is now forwarded from the `*Params` structs, so `OUTPUT_LEN` / `BLOCK_LEN` are
  defined once. Removed misleading leftover SHA-2 block-size comments.
* Crate docs gained "Memory Usage" and "Security Considerations" sections.

Testing:

* SHA-3 / SHAKE now run the NIST CAVP SHA3VS vector sets from bc-test-data (`crypto/sha3`: ShortMsg, LongMsg, Monte
  Carlo and SHAKE VariableOut; bit- and byte-oriented, ~13k cases) using the same `../bc-test-data` lookup convention as
  the mldsa/mlkem crates; the tests skip with a warning if the repo is not checked out. The vendored FIPS 202 example
  vectors in `crypto/sha3/tests/data` were removed in favour of the bc-test-data copies. Note that `cargo mutants` runs
  in a copied tree where `../bc-test-data` does not resolve, so these tests do not contribute to mutation coverage.
